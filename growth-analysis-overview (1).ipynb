The dataset includes key financial metrics such as revenue, market cap, net income, and earnings per share, among others. By performing a growth analysis, we aim to identify trends and patterns in the performance of various companies, with a particular focus on understanding which companies have experienced the highest and lowest revenue growth over time.\n\nWe will employ data manipulation techniques using Pandas to clean, preprocess, and analyze the dataset. Key steps include handling missing values, removing irrelevant data, and calculating the YoY growth rate for each company. We will visualize the results using various graphical representations, such as line graphs and bar charts, to provide a clear view of the performance of these companies over the period analyzed. The final goal is to draw conclusions that will provide insights into which companies are thriving in terms of revenue growth and which ones are facing challenges.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Import and Cleanup","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport warnings\n\n\n\n# Suppress specific warnings related to formatting\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=RuntimeWarning)\n\n# Load the dataset from the given path\ndf = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/financial-statements-of-major-companies2009-2023/Financial Statements.csv')\n\n# Strip leading and trailing spaces from column names\ndf.columns = df.columns.str.strip()\n\n# Check for any non-numeric values in the Revenue column\ndf['Revenue'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Revenue'], errors='coerce')\n\n# Forward fill missing values in Revenue column\ndf['Revenue'] = df['Revenue'].ffill()\n\n# Sort the data by Company and Year to ensure proper calculation\ndf.sort_values(by=['Company', 'Year'], inplace=True)\n\n# Calculate Year-over-Year (YoY) growth for Revenue (Revenue change compared to previous year)\ndf['YoY Growth'] = df.groupby('Company')['Revenue'].pct_change() * 100\n\n# Replace infinite values with NaN and forward fill any NaN values in Revenue\ndf['Revenue'] = df['Revenue'].replace(np.inf, np.nan)\ndf['Revenue'] = df['Revenue'].ffill()\n\n# Display the data with the new YoY Growth column\nprint(df[['Company', 'Year', 'Revenue', 'YoY Growth']].head())\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-03T21:04:46.078788Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Sorting and Year-over-Year Growth Calculation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Summarize the YoY Growth analysis for each company\nsummary = df.groupby('Company')['YoY Growth'].describe()\n\n# Display the summary\nprint(summary)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Replace all positive and negative infinity values with NaN\ndf.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan, inplace=True)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Use the forward fill method directly to fill missing values\ndf.ffill(inplace=True)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Make sure the 'Revenue' column is of numeric type\ndf['Revenue'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Revenue'], errors='coerce')\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Sort the data by Company and Year to ensure proper calculation\ndf.sort_values(by=['Company', 'Year'], inplace=True)\n\n# Calculate Year-over-Year (YoY) growth for Revenue (Revenue change compared to previous year)\ndf['YoY Growth'] = df.groupby('Company')['Revenue'].pct_change() * 100\n\n# Display the data with the new YoY Growth column\nprint(df[['Company', 'Year', 'Revenue', 'YoY Growth']])\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Graphing the Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Ensure 'Year' and 'Revenue' are numeric\ndf['Year'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Year'], errors='coerce')\ndf['Revenue'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Revenue'], errors='coerce')\n\n# Fill any missing values in 'Revenue' using forward fill\ndf['Revenue'] = df['Revenue'].ffill()\n\n# Remove rows where 'Year' or 'Revenue' are still NaN\ndf = df.dropna(subset=['Year', 'Revenue'])\n\n# Create a plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\n\n# Loop through each unique company and plot their revenue over time\nfor company in df['Company'].unique():\n    company_data = df[df['Company'] == company]\n    plt.plot(company_data['Year'], company_data['Revenue'], label=company)\n\n# Adding labels and title\nplt.xlabel('Year')\nplt.ylabel('Revenue in Million USD')\nplt.title('Revenue Over Time for All Companies')\n\n# Rotate x-axis labels for better readability\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.boxplot(data=df, x='YoY Growth')\nplt.title('Distribution of Year-over-Year Revenue Growth')\nplt.xlabel('YoY Growth (%)')\nplt.show()\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"unique_companies = df['Company'].unique()\nn = len(unique_companies)  #

Other companies that demonstrated strong growth include Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and PayPal (PYPL), all of which experienced growth rates exceeding 16%. These companies have likely benefited from factors such as innovation, market expansion, or increased demand for their products and service\n\nOn the other hand, several companies faced negative or low growth. Sears Holdings (SHLDQ) experienced the sharpest decline with a YoY growth rate of -10.5%, reflecting significant financial struggles. Other companies in the bottom five, such as Barclays (BCS), American International Group (AIG), McDonald's (MCD), and PG&E (PCG), exhibited weak growth, some of which were even negative.

The Top 5 Companies with Highest Growth, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Apple (AAPL), all demonstrated impressive performance, with Amazon leading the pack at a YoY growth of 26.68%. This growth can be attributed to various factors, including Amazon's strong position in the e-commerce and cloud services industries. Notably, Amazon’s revenue surge around 2020 can likely be attributed to the global shift toward online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic. With physical stores closing and more people relying on e-commerce, Amazon saw a substantial increase in demand for its products and services, leading to higher revenues.\n\nIn contrast, the Bottom 5 Companies with Lowest Growth, such as McDonald's (MCD) and Pacific Gas and Electric (PCG), faced significant challenges. McDonald's, for example, experienced a significant dip in revenue around 2020, dropping below $20,000 million in revenue, while Amazon's revenue was approximately double that. This can be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, which greatly impacted the restaurant industry. With lockdowns and restrictions on dining out, McDonald's revenue dropped significantly as customers were forced to stay home, which led to a decline in foot traffic to their stores. This highlights the vulnerability of companies heavily reliant on physical customer interactions, in contrast to the e-commerce boom experienced by Amazon.\n\nIn addition to the industry-specific effects, other factors such as leadership, operational efficiency, and market conditions likely played a role in the underperformance of companies like McDonald's and Pacific Gas and Electric. Companies that were slower to adapt to new market conditions or those in industries more vulnerable to external shocks (such as retail or energy) faced difficulties in maintaining revenue growth.\n\nOverall, understanding the broader context—such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior—provides valuable insights into why certain companies thrived while others struggled. It is important for companies to continually adapt to shifting market conditions, innovate, and consider external factors that may influence their growth trajectory.","metadata":{}}]}
